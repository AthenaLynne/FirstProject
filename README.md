# FirstProject
#I am just starting to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML and CSS seem very straight forward but JS sure seems like an entirely different language!
This project was part of the intro to CodeLabs corsework and a way to dip my toes in to coding to see if I like it enough to persue it as a career.
